Scenerios Tested:
Creating a new compute cluster: Passed
Deleting an existing compute cluster: Passed
Replacing an exisitng compute cluster with same name and different compute configuration:
Test scenerio:Failed
Compute cluster: mdna-ml-compute-cluster-001 with Standard_D11_v2 (2 cores, 14 GB RAM, 100 GB disk) 
is being repalced by Standard_D13_v2
Exisitng Principal ID: System assigned identity: f03c6032-54b9-4081-a3b2-c469415c09f8

After test: 
Before the approval it showed that it is going to delete and create the new one. After running the pipeline. The old one got deleted and no new compute cluster was created and the pipeline ran successfully
What ifs scenerios
What happens if ML Compute Cluster List is blank and I run the pipeline

After the pipeline run:

Good to have:
