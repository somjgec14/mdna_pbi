I have the following dataframe: 
df_sm_manual
Columns: 
 |-- Application_Name: string (nullable = true)
 |-- Semantic_Model_ID: string (nullable = true)
 |-- Semantic_Model_Name: string (nullable = true)

Another Table with the following columns: 
Table Name: LH_SLA_Monitoring.mard_sla.t_sm_metadata 
From this table i have the following columns: 
|-- WorkspaceID: string (nullable = true) 
|-- WorkspaceName: string (nullable = true) 
|-- SM_ID: string (nullable = true) 
|-- SM_Name: string (nullable = true) 
|-- Web_URL: string (nullable = true) 
|-- configured_by: string (nullable = true) 
|-- is_Refreshable: boolean (nullable = true) 
|-- target_Storage_Mode: string (nullable = true) 
|-- created_Date: string (nullable = true) 

I want to create a new df called df_wid_smid 
Which will have the following columns 
Distinct combination of WorkspaceID, WorkspaceName, SM_ID, SM_Name and 
these are to be renamed as following: Workspace_ID, Workspace_Name, Semantic_Model_ID, Semantic_Model_Name
and then filter out only those columns
Where Semantic_Model_ID = emantic_Model_ID from df_sm_manual

Then fianlly show the entire dataframe: df_wid_smid 

Table Name: 
LH_SLA_Monitoring.mard_sla.t_pbi_sm_refresh_history
