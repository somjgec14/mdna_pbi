(Slide 1: Engaging Title Slide - "Mobility Data Analytics & AI Tribe: A Year of Impact - 2025 Highlights")

Presenter: Good morning/afternoon, everyone!
Myself Soumya and I would be representing Mobility Data Analytics & AI Tribe. 

2025 was quite an eventful year where we had a lot of topics, out of which we have chosen these highlights, 
but these are not the only ones. 

(Transition to Slide 2: "Delivering Value: Regular Go-Lives & Key Work Topics") --skip

Let's dive straight into the value we delivered. 

RACE OWIT Migration was a huge success, having significant business appreciation and 
paving the way for the crucial SAP BW PBF shutdown. 

Our team in Data Management Consulting & Implementation Program has established 
a new pay-per-activation process with Daimler Truck, streamlining their operations.

A major leap forward was Project GenAI: 
Mobility Manufacturing Agent (MMA), 
which we successfully piloted in 10 plants – a true testament to our innovative spirit. 

We also celebrated the GoLive of ECMFuture UserCockpit under Project MDNA, 
providing a much-needed one-stop overview for engineering change requests, 
simplifying processes for our users. 
And on the compliance front, we have the  successful completion of :MCR/CSS EY Audit 2025 with no findings

Also BBM AI Performance Hub saw significant expansion with the  Ask BOSCH BBM Process Compass Agent, 
now providing a comprehensive Process Compass Data Crawler and API, including MCP capabilities. 

This was a year of relentless execution!

---Next section

But it’s not just about what we built; it’s about the impact on our customers. 
Our dedication to customer centricity truly shined. 
Data Management Consulting & Implementation received stellar feedback, 
achieving a perfect CX5 rating of 5 out of 5 stars – a remarkable achievement. 

Our innovation was also recognized with mDNA winning second place in the X-Perience Award!

Across the board, Project GenAI boasted high customer satisfaction and incredibly positive user feedback, 
directly translating into new use cases and continued demand. 
And a special shout-out to Mobility Manufacturing Agent (MMA), 
which is already generating high customer satisfaction 
and a growing base of promoter users which is the best way of marketing
Our users are seeing the difference.

From PoC to MVP: Innovation in Action"
Our commitment to innovation means constantly moving ideas from concept to reality. 

The BBM AI Performance Hub is a prime example, transitioning its PoC for BBM Sales Pathfinder to a full MVP, 
integrating seamlessly with the BBM Agent Portal and fostering strong collaboration with sales teams.

A truly exciting development was the PoC to MVP conversion for Project Risk Status Forecast 
within our GenAI and mDNA initiatives. 
This powerful tool is now predicting project risk with an impressive 75-83% accuracy, giving us a significant edge in proactive management. 
In mDNA Text to SQL Query PoC was successfully completed, laying groundwork for future advancements. 
The PoC on the Google Cloud Platform Stack for BBM AI performance hub topics, 
validating our technological direction.

(Transition to Slide 6: "Smart Solutions: Cost-Saving Initiatives")

And of course, we are always focused on efficiency and smart resource management. 
We delivered significant cost savings of 1 million Euros by completing the transition and migration 
of 14 applications from PBF for shutdown – a huge win! 
We also achieved efficient platform management from Operations excellence 
through internally developed tools, saving money and enabling us to reinvest in further innovation. 
Finally, our Project mDNA: Click Dashboard is providing valuable insights by centralizing and 
visualizing organizational data, driving smarter decision-making.

NExt and one of the most important topics i.e. Growing Together: Workshops & Global Collaboration"

Our success isn't just about technology; it's about our people. We held impactful 
team workshops across India, Germany, Vietnam, Bulgaria
fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. 

A highlight was the onsite visit to China, allowing us to directly demonstrate our solutions and gather critical requirements first-hand. 
These connections strengthen our global footprint and understanding.


What a year it has been. Our Mobility Data Analytics and AI team has not only delivered critical projects and fostered strong customer relationships 
but also continuously innovated and optimized our operations. 
These highlights represent countless hours of dedication, expertise, and collaboration.
I think We are not just building tools; we are shaping the future of mobility through data and AI.
