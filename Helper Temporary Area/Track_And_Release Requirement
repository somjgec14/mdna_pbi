How we can acheive that
1. Bring the track and release data to oracle via the redmesh platform team and then bring to MS Fabric  --- Known path -- for ETAS team 
we have done this: Jainendra and Tran Thi Nhung (BD/DAD-DEN2)

2. Using pyspark and Atlassian Rest APIs bring the data to MS Fabric Lakehouse --- Yet to be experimented or tried ---

3. Using Power BI/Power Query get the data and then refresh it. Later on through power Automate + Streaming dataset you can store it back
