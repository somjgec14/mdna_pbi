In Dev workspace try the following
Copy the production data to dev workspace


Chrome --> Outh2 --> Power BI report --> Secret ID ---> Access that same report. 

Py Application-->Chrome-->o2--> secretID --->API

Workspace Name: mDNA Click Dashboard [Development]
Semantic Model Name: Click Dashboard Fabric Semantic Model
Semantic Model Name from where measures and relationships need to be copied: sm_click_dashboard

Now I want to copy all the measures and relationships from sm_click_dashboard and replicate it in Click Dashboard Fabric Semantic Model
All the table names are same in both the models. 
I have heard that using Powering this feature: Semantic Link

This notebook leverages Semantic Link, a python library which lets you optimize Fabric items for performance, memory and cost. The "run_model_bpa" function used in this notebook is just one example of the useful functions which Semantic Link offers.

You can find more functions and helper notebooks in Semantic Link Labs, a Python library that extends Semantic Link's capabilities to automate technical tasks.
Sample code can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs#featured-scenarios
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-overview


I am not sure about this just read it in microsoft documentation

I have another task I want to change the source of a report

Report Name: Click Dashboard Fabric
Current Semantic Model Name: Click Dashboard Fabric Semantic Model
Target Semantic Model Name: sm_click_dashboard

Can this be done too ?
