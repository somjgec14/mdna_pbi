In our project we have implemented CI/CD then to check how much we have improved we implemented DORA MEtrics:


DORA Measures the following KPIs
Failed deployment recovery time (FDRT):Time to recover from production failures.
Lead Time for Changes (LTFC): Time from code commit to production deployment.
Deployment Frequency (DF): How often we deploy code to production.
Change failure rate (CFR): Percentage of deployments causing production failures.

And the followign impact has happened directly 
Our DF increased from twice in a week to whenever we want in working hours
Our Lead Time for Changes (LTFC) has been from 1-2 working days of manual effort to automated which takes max 1 hour and is just a press of a button

Indirect Effects:
Improved Change Failure Rate (CFR):
Before: High and unpredictable, due to manual errors.
After: Significantly Reduced.
Impact: Automated, standardized deployments eliminate human error, leading to more stable and reliable releases.
Improved Failed Deployment Recovery Time (FDRT):
Before: Hours or even days to identify, fix, and redeploy.
After: Minutes.
Impact: The automated pipeline allows us to quickly roll back to a previous stable version or roll forward with a fix, drastically minimizing downtime and customer impact.
