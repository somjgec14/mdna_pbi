Key Observations
Significant reduction in impact minutes on main capacity, decreasing from 3,500 to 2,500 minutes.
Root Causes

iGPM & Across: Use of Analyze in Excel.
Eolix: Refreshing large volumes of modeled data.

Applications Affected
iGPM, EOLIX, m.GMC.

For the 20-Unit Capacity

    Development team is re-modeling m.GMC’s data structure to improve efficiency.
    Developers addressed issues in:
       Aggregate Refine Control Cash Flow (Development).
       IDC – Internal Defect Cost (Production).
   Problems were resolved, preventing further disruptions.

 Current Challenge

   Overall CU utilization has increased, requiring additional measures:

Recommendations (one after the other)
For all mDNA Applciations
1.  Increase mdna capacity02 from F64 to F128  
    Estimated cost: \~4 TEUR/month.
For Across: 
1.  Create a separate capacity (mdnacapacity03) of F64 dedicated to Across.  
    MS domain may bear 25–50% of the cost (\~4 TEUR/month).
2.  Optimize Power BI reports for Across.  
    Seek free MS consulting for optimization (may have limitations).
