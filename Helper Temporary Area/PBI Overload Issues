Problem Statement 

PO and users are complaining that Across Application is too slow.

Reason: 
- Across is in the same capacity as IGPM MCR Application and they share the same resources. Mostly iGPM utilizes most of the resources
- Across is a big application so it cannot be on boarded in the samller capacity as it will affect the other 29 applications in the smaller capacity


Solution

- Create a seperate capacity for Across with same configuration as the smaller one
- Increase the capacity of the smaller capacity and then on board across in that capacity

Cost information
 - In both solutions the cost of increasing is same
