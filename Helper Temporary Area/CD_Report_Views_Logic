Create a new table called
mard_mdna_T_Report_Views_Ratio



Query 2: 
SELECT 
    [Date], 
    [WorkspaceId], 
    SUM([ReportViews]) AS Report_Views
    --COUNT(DISTINCT [Userkey]) AS Unique_Users, 
FROM 
    [Click_Dashboard].[dbo].[mard_mdna_t_mdna_pbi_usage_metrics] -- Auto-Fix: Specified the correct table to select from
GROUP BY 
    [Date], 
    [WorkspaceId] -- Auto-Fix: Ensured GROUP BY clause matches the SELECT statement
ORDER BY 
    Unique_Users DESC; -- Auto-Fix: Used the alias Unique_Users in the ORDER BY clause for clarity



Query 1:
SELECT
[Access_Date],
[PowerBIWorkspaceId],
COUNT(Distinct [ExecutingUser]) as Unique_Users
from [Click_Dashboard].[dbo].[mard_mdna_t_pbi_user_interaction_data]
group by [Access_Date],[PowerBIWorkspaceId]
order by Unique_Users DESC;

Left Join Query 2 and Query 1 
With Query 1 on left.
Common column 
[PowerBIWorkspaceId] and [Access_Date] from Query 1
[Date] and [WorkspaceId] from Query 2
 And column to be added to the left table is Report_Views from Query 2


Now after this add another calculated column called Views_Users_Ratio = Report_Views/Unique_Users and in float format

Using the above information I want to create a pyspark dataframe and save the data in a table using Microsoft Fabric Notebook

Table Name: mard_mdna_t_pbi_views_users_ratio

I need to create a measure in DAX
I have a table called: mard_mdna_t_pbi_user_interaction_data
Column Name: ExecutingUser

Another Table: mard_mdna_T_HR_MINIMASTER_COUNTRY
Column Name: Executing_User, COUNTRY_SHORT_TEXT

There is a relationship 1:M relationship between these tables where 1 is to the mard_mdna_T_HR_MINIMASTER_COUNTRY table 
Columns used for relationship is ExecutingUser, Executing_User

I want to have a measure called Count_Countries which counts
how many COUNTRY_SHORT_TEXT will be there with respect to mard_mdna_t_pbi_user_interaction_data
